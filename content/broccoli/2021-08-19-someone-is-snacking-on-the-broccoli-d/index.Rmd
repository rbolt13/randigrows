The broccoli leafs are full of holes from bugs, and are the only plant to be terrorized by the neighborhood animals by having their leaves literally bit clean off. I started these two plants from seeds in the middle of February this year, 2021. The smaller plant was bitten off when it was about a foot or so tall, but has sprouted back where it was bitten off. The second plant has been holding strong and was protected by two very tall lettuce plants until those were sort of destroyed and dug up after the heatwave in July. 

The broccoli didn't seem to be destroyed by the heatwave as the front end of the garden it sits in is shaded by the house and the neighbors walnut tree part of the day. However there are no signs of broccoli starting to grow. Started broccoli in February may have been a premature start date.
